            <p>Christa Caceres, 52, is a wife, mother, longtime community volunteer and political advocate.  She and her husband Enrique have lived in Saw Creek Estates in Pike County’s Lehman Township for 18 years. Enrique is the Purchasing Director at Kalahari Resorts and Conventions and their son, Josiah, attends East Stroudsburg High School.  
                Christa and Enrique are often seen in the baseball stands cheering on Josiah, a talented pitcher and first baseman.  If elected, she will be the only Pike County Commissioner with a child in the local public school system.
                Christa presently serves on the boards of directors of the Greater Pike Community Foundation, Pocono Mountains United Way and the Pocono Mountains Chamber of Commerce.  As Vice President of Saw Creeks Estates Community Association—the largest HOA in Pike County with nearly 3,000 homes, 42 miles of road and close to 8,000 residents—she is responsible for overseeing the property owner associations' 150 employees and $5m annual budget.
            </p><p>
                In the past, Christa served on the board of Safe Haven of Pike County, and until recently she was President of the Monroe County NAACP chapter. In that capacity, she led the effort to create a Community Roundtable, uniting the heads of local law enforcement agencies in Pike and Monroe counties to address community issues and find mutual solutions.
                </p>
                <p>She holds a B.A. in Jurisprudence and M.S. in Law and Public Policy from the California University of Pennsylvania.  For nearly five years, she worked to help constituents, including veterans and seniors, navigate federal bureaucracies as a Senior Constituent Advocate for U.S Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-8th District). Previously, she worked in the insurance industry.
                In 2022, the current Pike County Commissioners appointed her to be the founding chairperson of the newly-created Pike County Commission on Women.  In 2023, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro appointed her as Vice Chair of the Governor’s Advisory Council on African-American Affairs.
                Christa has long been active politically, as a 2018 candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Pennsylvania legislature, service on the Pike County Democratic Committee and as chairperson of the Lehman Township Democratic Committee.  
                </p>
                <p>
                The Pocono Mountains United Way honored Christa with their 2022 Community Impact Award and in 2021, East Stroudsburg University honored her with their Martin Luther King Community Service Award.
